# TaxiMatching

The software will provide a service to customers of the taxi company, allowing them to conveniently set up and join carpools. Users will be able
to offer to carpool from their taxi, or join a carpool heading to the same destination. This allows users to save money on taxi fares and the taxi company to save time and fuel, and attract more customers. This app also offers users the opportunity to participate in a fun ”Wordle Wednesday” challenge, where they will be rewarded with a discounted fare for entering the word of the day each Wednesday.


How to Run the App: 
1. Open a terminal and type the following commands
2. npx create-expo-app MyNewApp
3. cd AwesomeProject
